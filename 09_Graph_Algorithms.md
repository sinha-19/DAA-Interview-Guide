## What is a Graph?

A **graph** is a collection of **nodes** (vertices) and **edges** (connections) between them.  
Graphs can be **directed** or **undirected**, **weighted** or **unweighted**, **cyclic** or **acyclic**.

---

## Common Graph Representations

- **Adjacency Matrix:** 2D array, O(VÂ²) space.
- **Adjacency List:** Array/list of lists, O(V + E) space.

---

## Traversal Algorithms

### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- Explores nodes in all directions, level by level.
- Uses a queue (FIFO).
- Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Applications:** Shortest path, finding connected components, bipartite check.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def BFS(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = [start]
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[node] if neighbor not in visited)
```

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Uses a stack (can be implemented recursively).
- **Time Complexity:** O(V + E)
- **Applications:** Cycle detection, topological sort, connected components.

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def DFS(graph, node, visited=set()):
    if node not in visited:
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            DFS(graph, neighbor, visited)
```

## Shortest Path Algorithms

### 1. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

- Finds shortest path from a source node to all others in a weighted graph (no negative weights).
- Uses a priority queue.
- **Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V) with min-heap.

### 2. Bellman-Ford Algorithm

- Handles negative weights.
- **Time Complexity:** O(VE)
- Detects negative cycles.

### 3. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

- All-pairs shortest path.
- **Time Complexity:** O(VÂ³)

---

## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms

### 1. Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm

- Greedily adds lowest-weight edge without creating cycles.
- Uses Union-Find data structure.
- **Time Complexity:** O(E log V)

### 2. Primâ€™s Algorithm

- Grows MST from a starting vertex, always adding the smallest-weight edge.
- **Time Complexity:** O(E log V)

---

## Other Important Graph Algorithms

- **Topological Sort:** For Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
- **Connected Components:** Find clusters in the graph (BFS/DFS).
- **Cycle Detection:** Detects if a graph contains cycles (BFS/DFS).
- **Bipartite Check:** Checks if a graph can be colored with two colors.

## Applications

- Social networks, navigation/maps, scheduling, circuit design, networking, recommendation systems, etc.
