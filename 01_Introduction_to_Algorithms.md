# 1. Introduction to Algorithms

## What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions to solve a specific problem or perform a computation. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and programming.

---

## Features of a Good Algorithm

- **Input:** Clearly defined inputs (zero or more).
- **Output:** Clearly defined output(s), related to the inputs.
- **Definiteness:** Each step is precisely and unambiguously defined.
- **Finiteness:** The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Effectiveness:** Each step must be basic enough to be carried out, in principle, by a person using only pencil and paper.

## Why Study Algorithms?

- **Problem Solving:** Algorithms are the backbone of solving computational problems.
- **Efficiency:** Good algorithms solve problems faster and with fewer resources.
- **Scalability:** Efficient algorithms handle larger inputs as systems grow.
- **Interview Preparation:** Most technical interviews focus on algorithmic thinking.

## Real-World Examples

| Problem                | Algorithm Example        |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Sorting numbers        | Bubble, Merge, Quick    |
| Searching in a list    | Linear, Binary Search   |
| Route finding          | Dijkstraâ€™s, A*          |
| Data compression       | Huffman Coding          |
| Encryption             | RSA, AES                |

## Algorithm vs. Program

| Algorithm                                | Program                        |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Step-by-step logical procedure            | Implementation in a language  |
| Language-independent                      | Language-dependent            |
| Blueprint for solving the problem         | Actual executable code        |

## Algorithm Design Process

1. **Understand the Problem**
2. **Devise a Plan (Algorithm)**
3. **Write Pseudocode or Flowchart**
4. **Analyze the Algorithm (Complexity)**
5. **Implement Using Programming Language**
6. **Test and Debug**

## Pseudocode Example

```plaintext
Algorithm FindMax(A, n):
    max = A[0]
    for i = 1 to n-1
        if A[i] > max
            max = A[i]
    return max
```

2. What are the essential characteristics of an algorithm?
3. Give a real-world example where an algorithm is used.
4. How does an algorithm differ from a program?
5. What is pseudocode and why is it useful?
