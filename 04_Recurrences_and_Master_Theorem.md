# 4. Recurrences and Master Theorem

## What is a Recurrence Relation?

A **recurrence relation** expresses the running time of a recursive algorithm in terms of its running time on smaller inputs.  
Itâ€™s an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of its value on smaller inputs.

---

### Example

- **Binary Search:**  
  T(n) = T(n/2) + c  
  (Where c is the constant time for comparison and splitting)

- **Merge Sort:**  
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn  
  (Divide into two subproblems of size n/2, merge takes linear time)

---

## Why Solve Recurrences?

- To determine the time complexity of recursive algorithms.
- Many divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming algorithms are naturally represented by recurrences.

---

## Methods to Solve Recurrences

1. **Substitution Method:**  
   Guess the solution and then use induction to prove it.

2. **Recursion Tree Method:**  
   Visualize the recurrence as a tree and sum the work at each level.

3. **Master Theorem:**  
   Provides a shortcut to get asymptotic bounds for recurrences of a specific form.

---

## Master Theorem

The **Master Theorem** is a direct way to find the time complexity for recurrences of the form:

```
T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)
```
Where:  
- **a** = number of subproblems in the recursion  
- **n/b** = size of each subproblem  
- **f(n)** = cost of work done outside the recursive calls (divide/merge/combine steps)

---

### Cases of Master Theorem

Let **k = log_b(a)**

1. **Case 1:** If f(n) = O(n^c) where c < k  
   **T(n) = Î˜(n^k)**
2. **Case 2:** If f(n) = Î˜(n^k)  
   **T(n) = Î˜(n^k * log n)**
3. **Case 3:** If f(n) = Î©(n^c) where c > k and regularity condition holds  
   **T(n) = Î˜(f(n))**

---

### Examples

- **Merge Sort:**  
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn  
  a = 2, b = 2, f(n) = Î˜(n)  
  k = logâ‚‚2 = 1, f(n) = Î˜(n^1)  
  â†’ Case 2 â‡’ T(n) = Î˜(n log n)

- **Binary Search:**  
  T(n) = T(n/2) + c  
  a = 1, b = 2, f(n) = Î˜(1)  
  k = logâ‚‚1 = 0, f(n) = Î˜(1)  
  â†’ Case 2 â‡’ T(n) = Î˜(log n)

- **Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication:**  
  T(n) = 7T(n/2) + Î˜(nÂ²)  
  a = 7, b = 2, f(n) = Î˜(nÂ²)  
  k = logâ‚‚7 â‰ˆ 2.81, f(n) = O(nÂ²) (c < k)  
  â†’ Case 1 â‡’ T(n) = Î˜(n^logâ‚‚7) â‰ˆ Î˜(n^2.81)

---

## When Not to Use Master Theorem

- The recurrence is not in the required form (e.g., T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + O(1))
- Subproblems are of different sizes
- a or b are not constants

2. State the Master Theorem and its cases.
3. Use the Master Theorem to solve T(n) = 3T(n/2) + n.
4. Why canâ€™t you use the Master Theorem on T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2)?
5. Explain the recursion tree method briefly.
