# 5. Divide and Conquer

## What is Divide and Conquer?

**Divide and Conquer** is a fundamental algorithm design paradigm that works by recursively breaking a problem into two or more subproblems of the same (or related) type, solving them independently, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

---

## Steps in Divide and Conquer

1. **Divide:** Break the problem into smaller subproblems.
2. **Conquer:** Solve each subproblem recursively. If subproblem is small enough, solve it directly (base case).
3. **Combine:** Merge the solutions of the subproblems to get the solution to the original problem.

## General Structure (Pseudocode)

```plaintext
Algorithm DivideAndConquer(A, n):
    if n is small:
        Solve directly
    else:
        Divide A into subproblems A1, A2, ..., Ak
        Solve each subproblem recursively
        Combine solutions of subproblems
```

## Classic Examples

| Problem           | How D&C is Applied                         | Time Complexity      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Merge Sort**    | Divide array in halves, sort/merge         | O(n log n)          |
| **Quick Sort**    | Partition array, sort partitions           | O(n log n) avg      |
| **Binary Search** | Search one half recursively                | O(log n)            |
| **Matrix Multiplication (Strassenâ€™s)** | Split matrices, combine | O(n^2.81)           |
| **Closest Pair of Points** | Divide points, merge result        | O(n log n)          |

## Example: Merge Sort

- **Divide:** Split array into two halves.
- **Conquer:** Recursively sort the two halves.
- **Combine:** Merge the sorted halves.

**Recurrence Relation:**  
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)  
(Solved using the Master Theorem: T(n) = O(n log n))

## Advantages

- **Reduces complexity:** Breaks complex problems into manageable parts.
- **Parallelism:** Subproblems can often be solved in parallel.
- **Optimal for recursive problems:** Many naturally recursive problems fit this pattern.

---

## Disadvantages

- **Overhead:** Recursive calls and combining solutions may add overhead.
- **Space:** May use additional memory (e.g., merge sort uses O(n) extra space).

## Tips for Interviews

- Identify if the problem can be divided into similar, smaller subproblems.
- Write the recurrence relation for time complexity.
- Use the Master Theorem to solve the recurrence.
- Discuss base cases and combination logic.
