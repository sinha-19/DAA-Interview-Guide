# 18. Best Practices & Interview Q&A

---

## Best Practices in Algorithms & Data Structures

### 1. Algorithm Design

- **Clarify the Problem:** Before coding, ask clarifying questions and restate the problem in your own words.
- **Think Out Loud:** Explain your approach, possible edge cases, and trade-offs.
- **Start with Brute Force:** Briefly discuss the simplest solution before moving to optimized approaches.
- **Analyze Complexity:** Always discuss time and space complexity.
- **Use Appropriate Data Structures:** Choose the optimal data structure for the problem (arrays, hash maps, trees, etc.).
- **Handle Edge Cases:** Consider empty inputs, single elements, large numbers, duplicates, etc.

### 2. Coding & Testing

- **Write Clean, Readable Code:** Use meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and modular functions.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Check with typical, edge, and large input cases.
- **Avoid Premature Optimization:** First get a correct solution, then optimize.

### 3. Communication

- **Explain Your Thought Process:** Especially in interviews, keep the interviewer engaged with your reasoning.
- **Iterate on Feedback:** Adapt your approach if given hints or feedback.

## Interview Preparation Strategy

1. **Master Fundamentals:** Arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting/searching, DP, greedy, recursion.
2. **Practice Patterns:** Sliding window, two pointers, binary search, backtracking, bit manipulation.
3. **Mock Interviews:** Simulate real interviews with peers or online platforms.
4. **Review Mistakes:** Maintain an error log and revisit missed problems.
5. **Understand Common Algorithms:** Know how and why they work (not just code).

## Common Interview Questions & Tips

### Arrays & Strings

- Reverse an array/string.
- Find duplicates or missing numbers.
- Rotate an array.
- Two sum / subarray with target sum.

### Linked Lists

- Detect cycles.
- Reverse a linked list.
- Merge two sorted lists.

### Trees & Graphs

- Inorder, preorder, postorder traversal.
- Level order traversal (BFS).
- Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA).
- Detect cycle in a graph.

### Dynamic Programming

- Fibonacci sequence (DP/memoization).
- Coin change problem.
- Longest increasing subsequence.

### Others

- Implement LRU cache.
- Design a stack with min/max operations.
- Solve basic bit manipulation problems.

## Interview Day Checklist

- **Rest well** before the interview.
- **Arrive early** (or log in early for virtual interviews).
- **Have paper/pen** ready for sketches.
- **Listen carefully** to the problem statement.
- **Ask clarifying questions** before coding.
- **Discuss your approach** before starting to code.
- **Write code cleanly and test it.**
- **Review your code** for errors and edge cases.

## Good Habits for Success

- **Consistent Practice:** Regularly solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces.
- **Review Solutions:** Learn multiple approaches to the same problem.
- **Teach Others:** Explaining problems improves your understanding.
- **Stay Updated:** Follow new trends and patterns in interview questions.
