# 7. Dynamic Programming

## What is Dynamic Programming?

**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is an algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

---

## Key Features

- **Optimal Substructure:** The problem can be broken into subproblems, which can be solved independently and combined for the solution.
- **Overlapping Subproblems:** The same subproblems are solved multiple times.

---

## Types of Dynamic Programming

- **Top-Down (Memoization):**  
  Solve the problem recursively and store the results of subproblems in a table to avoid recomputation.

- **Bottom-Up (Tabulation):**  
  Solve all subproblems starting from the simplest and combine them to solve bigger subproblems, typically using iteration and tables.

## Steps to Solve a DP Problem

1. **Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.**
2. **Define the value of an optimal solution recursively in terms of smaller subproblems.**
3. **Compute the value of an optimal solution (typically using a table).**
4. **Construct an optimal solution from the computed information (if required).**

## Classic Examples

| Problem                       | DP Approach                  | Time Complexity |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| **Fibonacci Numbers**         | Store previous results       | O(n)           |
| **0/1 Knapsack**              | Table by weight and items    | O(nW)          |
| **Longest Common Subsequence**| Table by indices             | O(mn)          |
| **Matrix Chain Multiplication**| Table for subproblems        | O(nÂ³)          |
| **Edit Distance**             | Table by string indices      | O(mn)          |
| **Coin Change**               | Table for min coins          | O(nW)          |

## Example: Fibonacci (with Memoization)

```python
def fib(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fib(n-1, memo) + fib(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```
- **Without DP:** Exponential time O(2^n)
- **With DP:** Linear time O(n)

---

## Example: 0/1 Knapsack (Tabulation)

- Build a table `dp[i][w]` where `i` is item and `w` is weight.
- `dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], value[i] + dp[i-1][w-weight[i]])` if `weight[i] <= w`.

---

## When to use DP?

- When there are overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
- When a recursive solution has redundant calculations.

---

## Tips for Interviews

- Carefully identify state variables (parameters that define subproblems).
- Write down the recurrence and think about memoization or tabulation.
- Consider space optimization (sometimes you only need the last row/column).
- Be able to reconstruct the solution (not just the value).
